# gender-analyzer

<h4>A little javascript app that predict gender from given name.</h4>

This is a client application that fetch the data from [genderize.io](https://genderize.io) api.
Api basically predict the gender of the given name with probability.

I write a mini html page that can request data from api, asynchronously.

I used jquery for using its simple autocomplete and ajax methods.
